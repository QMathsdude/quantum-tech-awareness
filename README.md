# Introduction

> ___"Quantum Leap: University Malaya Student’s Awareness, Perception and Understanding Towards Quantum Technology (QT) and Its Potential in Malaysia."___

The above was a study I conducted among **University Malaya (UM) students** during **Semester 1** of the **2024/2025** academic year under the course GKI1001: Independent Research.

### The aim of the study was to:

1. Determine the level of awareness and understanding of UM students towards QT.
2. Investigate the perception of UM students towards QT.
3. Investigate UM student’s perception towards the potential for QT development within Malaysia.

## Methodology

### A) Experimental Design

**Quantitative method** via distribution of *surveys* was used in this study. ***A standardized online questionnaire*** (Google Forms) was distributed to respondents of the survey through various social media like Whatsapp and Telegram. 

There were ***three main sections*** in the questionnaire (excluding demography):

> 1. Knowledge and Awareness
> 2. Perception on Quantum Technology (QT)
> 3. Quantum and Malaysia

---

For each section, ***questions of different styles*** were asked. As an example:

- First section include simple questions to gauge respondent level of awareness and understanding towards:
    - Quantum Revolution 1 (QR 1), and
    - Quantum Revolution 2 (QR 2).
- Second section includes questions to obtain respondents opinion(s)/perception towards QT.
- Thirds section requires respondents to give their feedback and evaluation regarding QT’s potential in Malaysia.

### B) Demography

**Simple random sampling** was used in this study; however, the ***sample only included students*** from:

1. Faculty of Science (FS)
2. Faculty of Engineering (FE)
3. Faculty of Computer Science (FSKTM)

There were a total of ***105 respondents***, which were distributed as follows:

- 33 FS
- 38 FE
- 34 FSKTM

### C) Data Analysis Techniques

The data collected was analysed mainly using _Microsoft Excel_, although _Python_ was used to clean up some data. Overall, data was ***presented in three different ways***:

1. Mean and standard deviation (Likert scale)
2. Pie chart (%)
3. Funnel chart (%)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In general, the Likert scale rating system used was: 1 = Absolutely disagree, 2 = Disagree, 3 = More or Less, 4 = Agree, 5 = Strongly agree  

# Results

### I) Original Report

The [original report](original-report.pdf) analysed data from all 105 respondents *together-in-one*. Therefore, trends and observation from this report provides a more ***general overview*** of UM Science and Technology students' perception, awareness and understanding towards QT.

### II) Refined Reports

Meanwhile, a more comprehensive analysis was done, which *seperate students* from *different faculties* to analyze their trends and observations individually. The following reports provide a ***detailed insight*** into students' perceptions, awareness, and understanding of QT across different faculties:

- [Report on Students from Faculty of Science](report-science.md)
- [Report on Students from Faculty of Engineering](report-engineering.md)
- [Report on Students from Faculty of Computer Science](report-computer-science.md)

## Summary: Comparison between All Three Faculties

### 1. Level of Understanding and Familiarity

- Self-Rated Knowledge of Quantum Science
    - Science students have the highest self-rated knowledge of quantum science (Mean = 2.61) compared to Engineering (Mean = 1.95) and Computer Science (Mean = 1.91) students.
    
- Familiarity with Quantum 1.0
    - Science students have the highest familiarity with Quantum 1.0 (Mean = 2.24), followed by Computer Science students (Mean = 1.64) and Engineering students (Mean = 1.55).

- Familiarity with Quantum 2.0
    - Similarly, Science students also have the highest familiarity with Quantum 2.0 (Mean = 2.33), followed by Engineering students (Mean = 1.61) and Computer Science students (Mean = 1.56).

### 2. Level of Awareness Towards QT Initiatives

- Awareness of QT initiatives globally and locally follows the same trend, that is all three faculty students are not very aware (~60%) of any QT initiatives. Although, it seems there is a greater number of well-aware Science students (~10%) compared to Computer Science students (~5%) compared to Engineering students (none).

### 3. Perception Towards QT

- Perceived Benefits of QT
    - Science students see the greatest long-term benefits (Mean = 4.64), followed by Engineering (Mean = 3.97) and Computer Science (Mean = 3.97).

- Perceived Dangers of QT
    - Science students also perceive the highest risks (Mean = 3.36), followed by Computer Science (Mean = 3.26) and Engineering, who are the least concerned (Mean = 2.82).

### 4. Interest in QT

- Interest in QT is also highest among Science students (Mean = 3.82), followed by Engineering (Mean = 2.97) and Computer Science (Mean = 2.79). Science students foresee the highest long-term benefits from QT (Mean = 4.64), compared to Engineering (Mean = 3.97) and Computer Science (Mean = 3.97).

### 5. Who Deems QT the Most Important & Impactful?

- Science students rate QT as the most impactful technology (Mean = 3.88), significantly higher than Engineering (Mean = 3.29) and Computer Science (Mean = 3.23).

### 6. Who Believes QT Should Be Pursued in the Coming Decade?

- Science students are the strongest advocates for investing in QT within this decade (Mean = 4.21), followed by Engineering (Mean = 3.42) and Computer Science (Mean = 3.29).
- Similarly, Science students strongly support Malaysia investing in QT (Mean = 4.09), while Engineering (Mean = 3.37) and Computer Science (Mean = 3.00) show comparatively lower support.

# Conclusion

Science students demonstrate the highest level of understanding, awareness, and enthusiasm for QT. They perceive it as highly significant and believe in its long-term benefits, making them the strongest advocates for QT investment. Engineering students have moderate awareness and a balanced perspective on QT's benefits and risks, while Computer Science students, though interested, display the least enthusiasm and awareness among the three faculties.
